# NBSMidi
A Set of files to allow OpenNBS player to act more like a Midi Player, with a pack for minecraft as well

Developed primarally for use on https://github.com/Legacy-Edition-Minigames
Midi Keyboard used is a Yamaha YPT-240, with 355 current samples.

Currently, an increase to the low and high octave samples is planned, because as of now its just a pitch shifted version of the original sample
instead of a fresh proper recording, which causes high samples to play quickly and low samples to be drawn out, with some overall distortion

The issue is doing this requires re-recording all 355+ samples, naming, editing, compressing, and a bit more jank to get it to work, 2 additional times.
As i already spent about 3 months on and off to get this to its current state, i dont have plans or a timeframe of when or if i will do it

# Contributing a Song

# Crediting
If you use this pack on a server, i do ask that you provide credit for it, and hey, send me a link on discord as i love to see what
everyone works on
If you use a Contributed song, please Credit the Author of the song.

In the event you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach me on discord at username " Pixeo "

Im also open to assistance making samples sound better, or having people contribute samples, under the rules that they are 
compressed to not drastically increase file size of the pack, are Free Use with no restrictions not already outlined, and 
are something someone would commonly use. (yes this means no meme samples. this may change in the future depending on demand)

# KNOWN ISSUES
- lower end samples lag slightly behind regular pitched notes
    This is known, but i currently only have a theory on how to fix it, but it also could mess up every sample, and no major 
    means of executing it due to my lack of experience in audio production and editing tools like audacity
- Some samples are really faded / quiet
    this is partly related to the best fix of the above issue without obliterating everything, again, i know how to fix this issue,
    the issue is fixing it without manualy editing every individual sample from source. the easier option would genuinly just
    re recording all samples, with actual samples for low and high notes instead of pitch shifted versions

again, if you have even jank but working fixes for either of these, it would be greatly appreciated
